If you haven't already, follow the backend's setup and installation instructions in its repository to establish the backend component of the system. Once the backend is operational, you can proceed to run and interact with the frontend as described in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

Your system should have both the frontend and backend components working together to enjoy the full capabilities of the Employee Management System.

## Usage
